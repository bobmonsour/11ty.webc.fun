# 11ty.webc.fun

A site about building websites using 11ty and WebC that is built with 11ty and
WebC.

Code is from Evan Sheehan's repo, where he noted that he let the 11ty.webc.fun domain name expire.

I might publish this on a free Netlify domain...after checking with him. Ok, so I published it before checking with Evan (waiting to hear).

You can find the site at: [https://11tywebcfun.netlify.app/](https://11tywebcfun.netlify.app/).
